This game is simple. It was created by using 2d array.
There are three objects: red one is virus, blue one is doctor, grey one is man. Black one is just wall.
  Quantity of viruses can be different. It is chosen randomly.
  Quantity of doctors depends on player: you can click on one of the celles. When you clicked it becomes blue.
  Quantity of people also is chosen randomly.
There are also two buttons: "Stop" and "Start".
First when you run the game nothing will happen becouse you didn't click the "Start" button. Once you clicked the button game starts.
If you click "Stop" button game will stop.

Rules are simple:
  If virus meets a man, the man becomes a virus.
  If a doctor meets a virus: If quantity of virues that are around the doctor more than 3, then doctor becomes a virus.
  If quantity of viruses are less than 3, the viruses become  people.
